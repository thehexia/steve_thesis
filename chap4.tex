\chapter{Tutorial} \label{tutorial}

This chapter provides a tutorial on the syntax of Steve and using its language features. Steve's primary focus is to provide language features for declaring, specifying, and constructing the pipeline processing stages described in Chapter \ref{pipeline_model}. This chapter will explain how to represent packet headers, how to write decoding stages, how to write table stages, and how to use actions.

Throughout this chapter there be small semantic details mentioned when necessary. For complete details on the semantics of Steve, see the User's Guide in Chapter \ref{users_guide}.

For a complete reference of all Steve syntax, see Appendix \ref{ap:a}.

\section{Layouts} \label{Layout_tut}

Before pipeline processing stages can be written, programmers must specify the physical structure of a packet header.
