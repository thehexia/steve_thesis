\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces The flow of a packet through the Steve pipeline. The first phase is ingress processing, where a \textit {context} (described in Section 3.1.1\hbox {}) is built around the packet. Then a number of decoding and table matching stages may decode, modify, and make forwarding decisions on the packet. Event processing may take place on special circumstances. Lastly, the packet goes through egress processing, where it is ultimately forwarded (or dropped).\relax }}{15}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces The binding environment inside a context used to store the length and offset of fields, or the offset of headers. On the left, indexes one through sixteen represent the fields that can be extracted. Each field maintains a binding stack. Each element in the binding stack is a binding which stores the offset and length where an instance of that field can be found. \relax }}{17}
