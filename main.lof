The first phase is ingress processing, where a \textit {context} (described in Section 3.2.1\hbox {}) is built around the packet. Decoding stages decode and extract. Tables match packets and perform actions. Event processing may take place on special circumstances Egress processing decides where a packet is forwarded (or dropped).\relax }}{22}

On the left, indexes one through sixteen represent the fields that can be extracted. Each field maintains a binding stack. Each element in the binding stack is a binding which stores the offset and length where an instance of that field can be found. \relax }}{25}
