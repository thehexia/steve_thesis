The data plane's pipeline raise events which are handled by event handlers on the control plane. Event handlers make system calls back to the data plane to modify pipeline behavior or to re-enter special packets.\relax }}{12}

Then a pipeline, composed of decoders and tables, decide where the packet should be forwarded. Once the decision is made, the packet goes through egress processing before being forwarded.\relax }}{13}
