\begin{abstract}
Software-defined networking (SDN) promises to make network switches programmable to enable a class of intelligent networking applications
that can automate network flow direction in ways that conventional switches cannot.
We present \emph{Steve}, a protocol-independent, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing these networking applications on SDN devices.
Steve provides high-level language features for expressing protocol structure, decoding rules,
forwarding decisions, packet manipulation, and event handling for reactive non-distributed control planes.
These features define a packet processing pipeline -- the algorithm used to make forwarding decisions.

Steve solves two issues in SDN language development: safe packet access and safe pipeline composition.
Vulnerabilities in an application running a network switch can be disastrous, therefore the Steve compiler is designed to catch potential errors.
Steve uses a type and constraints system which enforces these safety guarantees.
To verify our work, we produced a Steve language compiler which implements these safety guarantees.
We also present four compilable Steve applications: a MAC and IPv4 learning switch, a stateless firewall, and a full-duplex wire.
These applications are tested with a runtime environment which provides Steve access to switch resources.
