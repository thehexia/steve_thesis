Software-defined networking (SDN) was created to bypass the limitations of conventional network switches.
SDN aims to make the control plane and data plane components of a switch programmable
rather than relying on built-in hardware and firmware.
Network functions such as switching, firewalls, and NAT can be defined in software that can be quickly loaded by the
SDN switch to change its behavior.
We present \emph{Steve}, a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing efficient programs for SDN devices.
Steve provides high-level language features for expressing protocol structure, decoding rules,
forwarding decision making, packet manipulation, and a reactive non-distributed control plane.

Steve solves three problems in SDN language development: protocol independence, program safety, and efficiency.
To these ends, we have developed an optimizing compiler that ensures safety through a specialized type and constraints system.
Steve compiled applications target Freeflow, a protocol independent virtual data plane designed to abstract the underlying hardware of an SDN switch.
To prove that Steve is expressive enough to write network functions,
we present four Steve programs: a MAC learning switch, a IPv4 learning switch, a firewall, and a full-duplex wire.
These applications were run on a Freeflow instance with a Linux x86 machine and had performance between 1 and 3 Mpps which is
impressive for non-specialized hardware execution.
